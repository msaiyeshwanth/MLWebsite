        <h1>1. Introduction:</h1>
        <p>
            Heart disease is ruling the charts of the most eminent causes of death all over the world.
Heart diseases allude to various contexts that affect proper functioning of heart. In the USA,
around 17.9 million people deceased due to heart disease in 2016. Heart diseases like
stroke, hypertension are very dangerous and lead to death.
So, a system with high accuracy is needed for early prediction of heart disease by
understanding the patterns that causes heart diseases. This helps in early detection of the
attack and the patient can be treated accordingly. Many systems based on various machine
learning and deep learning classification algorithm with fairly good accuracy have been
proposed. Due to rapid growth of population, the medical records are also increasing
exponential. It is tough to handle those huge amount of medical data. Many researches are
going on regarding this problem. One of the most challenging tasks is to prognosticate heart
disease in real-time. The most significant aspect of this paper is real-time prediction of
tweets. The possibility of heart disease in streaming data is prognosticated in real-time by
integrating Apache Spark and Apache Kafka.
The motive of the work is deploying a model with best possible accuracy on Cleveland
heart disease dataset 2016 from UCI repository and then by using this best model the
streaming medical data from twitter is predicted. This System incorporates three
components: 1. Building Offline Model, 2. Streaming Process Pipeline, and 3. Online
prediction. Aforementioned is built on Apache Spark and Apache Kafka which helps in
prediction of huge amount of data. The offline model is built by using four machine
learning algorithms LR, DT, RF, and SVM on full features and selected features by using
Univariate and Relief feature selection algorithms. Accuracy is improved by applying
hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation techniques. RF has achieved the highest
accuracy of 89.9%.
        </p>
        <h1>2. Methodology:</h1>
        <p>
            The architecture comprises three components specifically 1. Building Offline Model, 2.
Streaming Process Pipeline, and 3. Online Prediction, depicted in Fig. 1.1 below

        <h3>2.2 Streaming Process pipeline:</h3>
        
        <p>
            Apache Spark is affiliated with Apache Kafka for evaluating the model in real-time.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3 Online Prediction:</h3>
        <p>
            The selected model with highest accuracy (RF) will receive the data in the form of a vector
from Apache Spark and will prognosticate the heart disease.
        </p>
        <h1>3. Dataset:</h1>
        <p>
            This section broadly describes the outline of the dataset that was used in Building Offline
Model and also about the details of the dataset that was used for real-time evaluation of the
system.
        </p>
        <h3>3.1 The Cleveland Heart Disease Data set:</h3>
        <p>
            The outline of the dataset used to build the offline model component is discussed
underneath. The data set i.e., processed Cleveland data is an open-source data set [2], which
is available in UCI machine learning repository. The data set consists of 303 rows and 14
columns. The data set mentioned above contains 13 independent features and a dependent
class label variable. The class label column in the data set depicts the status of the heart
disease. The description of features of the dataset is presented in Fig. 1.3 below. The class
label variable holds five values, where a value 0 represents the deprivation of heart disease
whereas the residual values represent a possible existence of heart disease. The work
carried out on the dataset is binary class classification. So, the values in the class label are
scaled to hold either 0 or 1, where he value 0 holds its original description and value 1 is a
generalization of the residual values which indicates the existence of heart disease.
        </p>
        <h3>3.2 Real-time twitter data:</h3>
        <p>
            Twitter is a most popular social network platform and is widely used to share, post content
and to discuss various topics. Hence, twitter is recognized a best pedigree for real-time
health data. Users tweet the heart related tweets which constitute to the stream of tweets
that are to be retrieved from twitter. The filtered data from the tweets is used for the real-
time evaluation of the proposed prediction system. For the proposed system, to retrieve
tweet streams from twitter, it should establish an authorized connection with Twitter. This
connection is made using the Twitter streaming API. Twitter uses a protocol called OAuth
for an authenticated connection and security purposes, to access the services from twitter
and use the data. To make this authenticated connection we should apply for a developer
account on twitter. On a successful approval for a developer account, the user will be issued
unique keys, which can be used to establish an authenticated connection and access the
tweet streams. After the connection is established, tweets with the header “hrtdis” are
retrieved. The tweet consists of a sequence of values which appear in the same sequence as
in the training data.

        <h1>Conclusion and Future Plans:</h1>
        <p>
            A system developed on Apache Spark affiliated with Apache Kafka was presented in this
paper. This system comprises three components: 1. Building Offline Model,2. Streaming
Process Pipeline, and 3. Online Prediction. In Building Offline Model, the heart dataset was
utilized and ML models LR, DT, RF, and SVM have been developed on Full Features
besides Selected Features and accuracy was enhanced by using hyperparameter tuning and
K-Fold Cross-Validation techniques. By selecting the important features using Univariate
and Relief Feature Selection algorithms, the accuracy wasn't enhanced compared to the Full
Features in which RF achieved the best accuracy of 89.9%. RF was selected as the best
model because in Online Prediction we will use Full Features extracted from the tweets.
The Streaming Process Pipeline was created by integrating Apache Spark and Apache
Kafka. Apache Kafka will retrieve the tweets with header “hrtdis” and stores it in Kafka
Topic. Apache Spark will read the data in form of streams from the created Kafka Topic
and process the data and converts it into vector. The Online Prediction component will
receive the vector from Apache Spark and prediction will be done by using the RF model.
The RF model showed better accuracy than other competitive works.
In future, other methodologies like Deep Learning algorithms can be incorporated and
enhance the accuracy further to get more accurate predictions.
